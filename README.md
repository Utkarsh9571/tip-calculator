### What I learned

In this one, the calculation are rather simplistic than the last one (mortgage calculator).

When i started i give it a thought that how the calculation can work, i lays some states and then applied the logic directly at the destination and it worked perfectly.

Honestly, i'm kinda happy because as usual i had to ask gemini for some thing and obviously it'll give a compltete code, but not what i asked, and previously i would just copy-paste that thinking that was the way to do it, but in this when my logic working and it keeps giving a solution with logic in a seperete function, it made me do everything on my own.

I can't remember how to displya the error message, i was creating another variable for it, instead i just had to place the conditional in the right function.

Custom tip part is one of the most original thing done by me, i knew what could be the solution with how it would work, just need a push of how to do it, and gemini totally failed in providing so, but its different solutions gave me the solution i was looking for.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
